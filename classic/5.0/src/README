BUILDING CONFIGURE FILES FROM SOURCES

There are source files Makefile.am and configure.ac here that can be
used to build configure and Makefile.in.  These require GNU
autoconf-2.52 and automake-1.5.  autoconf versions prior to 2.50 will
almost certainly NOT work, and earlier versions of automake will also
most likely not work.

To generate the needed files, issue the following commands:

$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ automake -a -c 

Now do configure/make/make install like you normally would, and
everything should work.
