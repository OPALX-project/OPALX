This is the ``prf'' library, an extended and user programmable printf clone.
For a description of function and interface see the manual page (prf.3x).

The intent of the copyright notice in the sources is to avoid legal problems
and prevent others from claiming to be the author.  No further restrictions
are intended.

When installing the prf library system wide (e.g. in /usr/lib) changes and
extensions should be avoided except portability of software using the library
is not necessary.
Local changes and extensions are easy and intended.

This library inherently needs ``varargs''.  Thus prf.h includes <varargs.h>.
As buffered streams are a standard output destination, <stdio.h>
is also included by prf.h.  Some functions need <ctype.h> and
<string.h> (BSD) or <strings.h> (System V).
When porting/installing this library "prfflt.h" needs manual adaption.
It may be convenient to change "prf_p.c" to local standards, too.

There are some manifests, which when defined outside "prf.h" make the prf
library more standalone. Defined(PRF_NOSTDIO) masks inclusion of <stdio.h>,
and the definition and usage of the corresponding destination type.
Defined(PRF_NOLIBC) avoids the usage of all library functions,
i.e. in this case the prf library is complete, with the exception
of <varargs.h> which is always necessary.

As far as possible and meaningful the prf library is consistent
with ``printf'' as described in SVID and BSD 4.3 printf(1) manual page.
As those descriptions are not at all complete, different behaviour
of printf and prf in some details should be expected.
As a reduced and encapsulated version of ``prf'' successfully has been
used by SPECS GmbH to implement printf in its BSD 4.3 port,
there should not be major problems.

Most exported identifiers use one of the prefixes "prf", "Prf" and "PRF".
Exceptions are a few manifests in prf.h ("PD"), and some functions.

This software is developed and running on a Clipper CPU with BSD 4.3.

In case you have bug fixes, useful extensions or important portability
fixes feel free to e-mail them to the author:
	heiner@specs.UUCP
As far as I like your changes, find the time to maintain the package
and net response justifies it I will try deal with further versions.
