OPAL is a tool for charged-particle optics in particle accelerators and beam lines. It can handle very large and very small accelerators and solves various problems on such machines. OPAL is based on the CLASSIC class library, 
and the features of the former Mad9p (space charge and parallelism).  The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes. This page is constantly being updated (once a day!).
