OPAL is a parallel tool for charged-particle optics in particle accelerators and beam lines with full 3D space charge. It can handle very large and very small accelerators and solves various problems on such machines. The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes. This page is constantly being updated (once a day!).
