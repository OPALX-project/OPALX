BUILDING CONFIGURE FILES FROM SOURCES

There are source files Makefile.am and configure.ac here that can be
used to build configure and Makefile.in.  These require GNU
autoconf-2.52 and automake-1.5.  autoconf versions prior to 2.50 will
almost certainly NOT work, and earlier versions of automake will also
most likely not work.

To generate the needed files, issue the following commands:

$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ automake -a -c 

Now do configure/make/make install like you normally would, and
everything should work.

configure has some options that you need to specify.  These are for
telling configure where to find the classic and doom library files.
First of all, you need to check out the classic and doom packages,
and build them.  Then, in configuring mad9, you must specify where to
find the appropriate files:

--with-classic-includedir=dir     classic include files are in
                                  subdirectories of dir
--with-classic-libdir=dir         libCLASSIC.a is in dir
--with-doom-includedir=dir        doom include files are in dir
--with-doom-libdir=dir            libdoom.a is in dir

CXX=mpicxx ./configure --with-classic-includedir=$HOME/NEW-MAD/classic/4.0/src  --with-classic-libdir=$HOME/NEW-MAD/classic/4.0/src --with-doom-includedir=$HOME/NEW-MAD/doom --with-doom-libdir=$HOME/NEW-MAD/doom
