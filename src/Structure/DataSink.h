/**
   \brief Class: DataSink
 
   This class acts as an observer during the calculation. It generates diagnostic
   output of the accelerated beam such as statistical beam descriptors of particle
   positions, momenta, beam phase space (emittance) etc. These are written to file
   at periodic time steps during the calculation.
   
   This class also writes the full beam phase space to an H5 file at periodic time
   steps in the calculation (this period is different from that of the statistical
   numbers).
   
   Class also writes processor load balancing data to file to track parallel
   calculation efficiency.
