Respected Referee (C)

we added Ref [22] which explains the binning concept in greater detail and further note that in our application
neither radiation not retardation effects play an significant role and can therefore be neglected. In the rest frame of the beam transverse currents effects can also be neglected and hence no longitudinal 
magnetic field component must be considered.

With the best regards

Andreas Adelmann \& Jianjun Yang
