The analysis is carried out for a thin beam with characteristic beam radius rb<<S, and the transverse momentum components and axial momentum spread of the beam particles are assumed to be small in comparison with the directed axial momentum &gamma;bm&beta;bc. The general formalism is applied to a periodically focused Vlasov equilibrium with step-function radial density profile and average azimuthal motion of the beam corresponding to a rigid rotation (in the Larmor frame) about the axis of symmetry. A variety of beam equilibrium properties are presented, such as the average flow velocity, and the transverse temperature profile.},

	Note = {Third-order explicit autonomous differential equations in one scalar variable or, mechanically interpreted, jerky dynamics constitute an interesting subclass of dynamical systems that can exhibit many major features of regular and irregular or chaotic dynamical behavior. In this paper, we investigate the circumstances under which three dimensional autonomous dynamical systems possess at least one equivalent jerky dynamics. In particular, we determine a wide class of three-dimensional vector fields with polynomial and non-polynomial nonlinearities that possess this property. Taking advantage of this general result, we focus on the jerky dynamics of Sprott's minimal chaotic dynamical systems and R?ssler's toroidal chaos model. Based on the interrelation between the jerky dynamics of these models, we classify them according to their increasing polynomial complexity. Finally, we also provide a simple criterion that excludes chaotic dynamics for some classes of jerky dynamics and, therefore, also for some classes of three-dimensional dynamical systems.

In ETRA3D, beam dynamics is calculated by the Hamilton equations, and a space-charge force is determined by the potentials produced by the other electrons. The Hamiltonian is assessed at each time-step, and the length of the time-step is varied by changing in the Hamiltonian to reduce calculation time and errors. The precision of ETRA3D was checked by comparing it with the envelope equation; the agreement between them was good. We demonstrated the capabilities of ETRA3D by an example in which the electron beam is not launched along the axis of a series of the solenoid coils; under this condition, two-dimensional codes cannot calculate its dynamics.

	Note = {e explore some of the effects that discreteness and two-body scattering may have on N-body simulations with ``realistic'' cosmological initial conditions. We use an identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a $128^3$ Particle-Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We investigate the effect of mass resolution (the mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have high resolution in gravitational force. The phase-insensitive two--point statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater differences. Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is held constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This shows high particle density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a PM run which continued the fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting in a high particle density. Since the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle separation, we find little justification for quantitative predictions on this scale. Some measures vary by 50 halos, formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc. Randall J. Splinter},

@article{Fang2001,
	Abstract = {Beam halo-chaos is essentially a complex spatiotemporal chaotic motion in a periodic-focusing channel of a high-power linear proton accelerator. The controllability condition for beam halo-chaos is analysed qualitatively. A special nonlinear control method, i.e.~the wavelet-based function feedback, is proposed for controlling beam halo-chaos. Particle-in-cell simulations are used to explore the nature of halo-chaos formation, which has shown that the beam halo-chaos is suppressed effectively after using nonlinear control for the proton beam with an initial full Gaussian distribution. The halo intensity factor  H $_{ av }$ is reduced from 14\% to zero, and the other statistical physical quantities of beam halo-chaos are more than doubly reduced. The potential applications of such nonlinear control in experiments are briefly pointed out. },

	Note = {{\em NOTES:} Not a mimetic publication per se, this early pure math book contains descriptions of generic tetrahedral edge- and face- elements etc. The "geometric integration" in the title has "nothing" to do with the numerical ODEs research area of the same name. From the review: "Integration, in the sense of an extended theory of differential forms, is developed here with an approach dual to that of the theory of currents (de Rham, L. Schwartz). An $r$-cochain is a linear function of polyhedral $r$-chains in Euclidean $E^n$. Integration enters by assuming continuity conditions on the cochain (so that then one can, by approximation, use the cochain to integrate over more general domains, such as curved surfaces); one requires the cochain to be bounded with respect to one of two norms in the linear space of polyhedral $r$-chains. The flat norm is defined by $|A|^{\flat}=\inf$\{$|A-\partial D|+|D|\colon D$ an $(r+1)$-chain\}, where $| |$ is the "mass" of a chain derived in the natural way from the $r$-volume. The sharp norm $|A|^{\sharp}$ takes into account the possibility of translating pieces of $A$ in various directions; $|A|^{\sharp}\leq|A|^{\flat}$ holds. By completion one gets the spaces of flat, resp. sharp, chains; their duals are the flat, resp. sharp, cochains. As an example, a flat 0-cochain is identical with a "real sharp" function, i.e., a real-valued bounded function with a uniform Lipschitz condition. These cochains are now identified with certain types of differential forms. The minor result (Thm. 10A) makes sharp cochains correspond to sharp forms; these are bounded and satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to a certain norm in the space of forms, called the comass. The major result (Thm. 7C due to J. H. Wolfe) identifies flat cochains with flat forms; these are forms that are measurable, and bounded in a certain sense. For $r=n$ this is classical theorem on differentiation of set functions, and identifies flat $n$-forms with bounded measurable functions. For $r=1$ it leads to Rademacher's theorem on differentiability of Lipschitz functions. The importance of flat cochains derives from the fact that the exterior derivative can be defined (as dual of the ordinary boundary in the space of chains); by the identification this defines the exterior derivative of a flat form. Similarly the exterior product exists for flat cochains; and for a complex $K\subset E^n$ there is an isomorphism between the flat cohomology ring and the usual algebraic cohomology ring. The "reasonable" maps of this theory are the Lipschitz maps; they preserve flat cochains, and have the usual properties. The theory is developed in many directions, e.g., the connection between sharp $r$-chains and measurable functions whose values are $r$-vectors. In addition there is given a development of Grassmann algebra, a treatment of differential forms in the classical sense including things like the implicit function theorem and differential forms in a smooth manifold, integration of continuous forms over simplexes by a straightforward Riemann-type process, a proof of Stokes' theorem for reasonable $(n-1)$-forms over domains with reasonable boundary in $E^n$ that seems very well adapted to the usual applications. Finally, there is a chapter with the theorem that smooth (separable) manifolds can be imbedded in Euclidean space, and utilizing this fact, a quite simple and straightforward proof for triangulability of smooth manifolds. An elementary proof of de Rham's theorem and some remarks on the Hopf invariant conclude this chapter. The introductory chapter provides the motivation for the general theory and treats the 3-dimensional case in detail."},

This permits us to assign a definite behaviour of physical quantities under time reversal and space inversion. The association of physical quantities with chrono-geometric objects gives a motivation for the introduction in physical theories of the notions of multivectors, fiber bundles, exterior differential forms and connection theory. Typical equations of physics are shown to be described by a single mathematical process, the coboundary process (exterior differential). The basic equations of physics are then divided into two classes: metric independent equations, i.e., purely topological equations, and metric dependent equations, the phenomenological equations. Classification schemes for the main physical theories conclude the paper."},

The construction of the operators is made in the following way. Directly on the mesh, they approximate one of the operators div, grad or rot and consider it as a determining difference operator. Under conditions of compatibility, similar to (1) but for tensor objects, the finite difference approximations of the other operators are derived. The technique developed is illustrated on the dynamic equations of continuous media for elastic-plastic flows. This novel method is perfectly suitable for numerical solution of the multidimensional, nonlinear problems of mathematical physics and may have a wide range of applications."},

With the exception of the last chapter the author considers the equation (1) $Lu=f(x)$, $x=(x_1, x_2)\in \Omega\subset \mathbf R^2$, with mixed boundary conditions where $Lu$ is a formally selfadjoint elliptic operator. The boundary value problem is briefly written in the form (2) $Au=F$. Irregular grids formed by triangles, rectangles and the combination of these elements are described in great detail. In addition, secondary grids are introduced by defining boxes via the perpendicular bisectors or via the medians. The balance method starts with identities called balance equations. For instance, in the case of the Poisson equation $-\Delta u=f(x)$, by using the Gauss formula we obtain (3) $-\int_{\partial \kappa} (\partial u/\partial n)\,ds=\int_\kappa f\,dx$ for all $\kappa \subset \overline{\Omega}$. Discretizing (3), where $\kappa$ is a box, by means of suitable quadrature and finite difference formulas we obtain the discrete operator $A_h$ and the discrete right-hand side $F_h$, and the discrete solution $y$ is defined by $A_h y=F_h$. Here $A_h$ and $F_h$ are constructed for the case that the operator $Lu$ is of the form $(4) Lu=-\sum^2_{i=1} (\partial/\partial x_i)(k\partial u/\partial x_i) +cu.$ The author studies the properties of $A_h$ and the corresponding matrices, especially with respect to monotonicity ($M$-matrices), symmetry and positive definiteness. Discrete analogues of Sobolev norms as well as the $C$-norm are introduced. A trace theorem, discrete analogues of the Green formula and of the Friedrichs-Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities are derived. Further, estimates of $A_h$ in different norms are given. An approach is developed to get error estimates and convergence proofs with discrete analogues of the $W^2_1$- and $C$-norms under the assumption that $u\in W^k_2(\Omega)$, $k\ge 2$. In the last short chapter the author applies the balance method to the solution of the diffusion-convection equation using upwind approximation with respect to the coordinate axes."},

For example, we require that the discrete divergence and gradient be negative adjoint of each other, ${\rm DIV}^*=-{\rm GRAD}$, and the discrete Laplacian is defined as ${\rm LAP}={\rm DIVGRAD}$. The adjointness requirement on the divergence and gradient guarantees that the Laplacian is a symmetric negative operator. The discrete approximations we derive are fourth-order on smooth grids, but the approach can be extended to create approximations of arbitrarily high order. We analyze the loss of accuracy in the approximations when the grid is not smooth and include a numerical example demonstrating the effectiveness of the higher order methods on nonuniform grids."},

The main subject matter is the "description of some regular methods for constructing intrinsically defined discrete models for special classes of continual objects". There is an introductory chapter giving an idea of what is meant, in the following, by finite models and their characteristics (Chapter 0: One-dimensional models). Five other chapters cover around 200 pages: 1. Formal structures, 2. Analysis of Riemannian manifolds, 3. The model of Euclidean space and difference operators, 4. Models in quantum physics, and 5. Structural analysis of discrete equations. Sixty-nine references are also specified (a majority of them being of difficult access) leading to very different concepts not sufficiently defined in the book. Addressed essentially to mathematical physicists, such a book asks for too many complementary readings in order to become interesting. I have personally visited the fourth chapter as a quantum physicist and I am still waiting for new results. Let me mention a typical way of thinking included in many parts of the book: the author writes "It should be pointed out in conclusion that it would be interesting to compare the content of Sections 1.2, 1.3 with the draft of quantum mechanics suggested by A. I. Kostrikin and Y. I. Manin [Linear algebra and geometry (Russian), Second edition, "Nauka", Moscow, 1986; MR 87f:00006]."

It is the generality of the problem (general matrix coefficients, general boundary conditions, general logically rectangular grids) that makes finding such an algorithm difficult.

	Note = {{\em NOTES:} Support Operator Method. Extensive bibliography. Preface: "The desire to solve challenging new problems imposes additional requirements for the quality and robustness of numerical algorithms used to simulate such problems. A number of factors in real problems make designing algorithms difficult, including nonlinearity, discontinuity of coefficients or solutions, complexity of the physical processes, and irregular geometry. Experience has shown that the best results usually are obtained by using discrete models that reproduce fundamental properties of the original continuum model of the underlying physical problem. Some of these important properties are conservation, symmetries of the solution, etc. Modeling becomes increasingly difficult as the number of physical processes increases, the shape of the physical domain becomes more complex, and boundary conditions are made more realistic. The development of discrete algorithms that capture all the important characteristics of such physical problems becomes more difficult with this increasing complexity. Thus, it is important to have a discretization method that is sufficiently general that it applies to a wide range of physical systems. Many important simulation algorithms necessarily involve the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Most of these PDEs can be formulated using invariant first-order differential operators, such as the divergence of vectors and tensors, the gradient of scalars and vectors, and the curl of vectors. Therefore, it is possible to construct `good' finite-difference schemes (FDSs) for approximating a wide class of problems, if it is possible to construct discrete analogues of these invariant operators so that the discrete operators also have `good' properties that are analogous to those of the continuum operators. "First-order differential operators are the main objects in vector and tensor analysis. These operators satisfy certain integral identities, usually associated with the names of Green, Gauss, and Stokes, that are closely related to the conservation laws of the continuum models. Therefore, to obtain high-quality FDSs, it is important to construct discrete analogues of the continuum divergence, gradient, and curl, which satisfy discrete analogues of these integral identities. In this book, FDSs are considered to be a discrete model of the continuum physical system. It is emphasized that, when computing numerical solutions to PDEs, the discrete difference operators should mimic the crucial properties of the continuum differential operators, and that such discretizations are usually more accurate than those that do not mimic these properties. Properties such as symmetry, conservation, stability, and the integral identities between the gradient, curl, and divergence are all important. The support-operators method for constructing FDSs that mimic these properties is emphasized in this book. The terminology `support operators' comes from the translation of papers in Russian. Unfortunately, this is not a good translation. More appropriate would be fundamental, basic, or reference operators. As many papers have been translated from Russian using this terminology, we have elected not to change it. Many of the standard finite-difference methods are special cases of the support-operators method. Also, it is important to realize that the popular finite-volume methods are special cases of the support-operators method. In this case the finite-volume approach gives an approximation of the divergence. Unlike elementary finite-difference methods, the support-operators method can be used to construct FDSs on grids of arbitrary structure. In addition, because invariant operators are used, the method can be easily used in any coordinate system. This gives some idea of the universality of the support-operators method. This book deals with the construction of finite-difference algorithms, in Cartesian coordinates, for three main types of equations: elliptic or steady-state equations, parabolic or diffusion equations, and gas dynamics equations in Lagrangian form. The methods apply to domains of arbitrary shape. Therefore this book gives scientists and engineers tools for solving real practical problems. The presentation of the material in this book is constructive; all of the details of algorithms needed for its implementation are given. The theoretical material is covered briefly and only when this contributes to a better understanding of the applications and properties of the algorithms. Many illustrations are used to help the reader understand the material. In addition, the results of solving many test problems are also presented. To increase the utility of the book, computer codes implementing the basic algorithms are provided on the floppy disk that is included with this book. This book is unique because it is the first book not in Russian to present the support-operators ideas. The background needed to understand this book is matrix theory, vector calculus, the elementary theory of PDEs, introductory finite-difference techniques, and elementary numerical programming techniques."},

	Note = {Support Operator Method. Summary: "A finite-difference algorithm for the numerical solution of diffusion problems in strongly heterogeneous and nonisotropic media is constructed for logically rectangular grids. The performance of this algorithm is comparable to other algorithms for problems with smooth coefficients and regular grids, and it is superior for problems with rough coefficients and/or skewed grids. The algorithm is derived using the support-operators method, which constructs discrete analogues of the divergence and flux operator that satisfy discrete analogues of the important integral identities relating the continuum operators. This paper gives the first application of this method to the solution of diffusion problems in heterogeneous and nonisotropic media. The support-operators method forces the discrete analogue of the flux operator to be the negative adjoint of the discrete divergence in an inner product weighted by the conductivity, as in the differential case. Once this is accomplished, many other important properties follow; for example, the scheme is conservative and the discrete analogue of the variable material Laplacian is symmetric and negative definite. In addition, on any grid, the discrete divergence is zero on constant vectors and the discrete flux operator is exact for linear functions in the case when $K$ (the conductivity matrix) is piecewise constant. Moreover, the discrete gradient's null space is the constant functions, just as in the continuum. Because the algorithm is flux based, it has twice as many unknowns as more standard algorithms. However, the matrices that need to be inverted are symmetric and positive definite, so the most powerful linear solvers can be applied. Also, the scheme is second-order accurate so, all things considered, it is efficient. For rectangular grids, the discrete operators reduce to well-known discrete operators and the treatment of discontinuous conductivity coefficients in the case of isotropic media is equivalent to the well-known harmonic-averaging procedure. Comparison with standard schemes is presented. Numerical examples validate the advantage of the new method."},

Summary: "We present an expanded mixed finite element method for solving elliptic second-order partial differential equations on geometrically general domains. For the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces, we use quadrature rules to reduce the method to cell-centered finite differences, possibly enhanced with some face-centered pressures. This substantially reduces the computational complexity of the problem to a symmetric, positive definite system for essentially only as many unknowns as elements. Our new method handles general shape elements (triangles, quadrilaterals, and hexahedra) and full tensor coefficients, while the standard mixed formulation reduces to finite differences only in special cases with rectangular elements. As in other mixed methods, we maintain the local approximation of the divergence (i.e., local mass conservation). In contrast, Galerkin finite element methods facilitate general element shapes at the cost of achieving only global mass conservation. Our method is shown to be as accurate as the standard mixed method for a large class of smooth meshes. On nonsmooth meshes or with nonsmooth coefficients one can add Lagrange multiplier pressure unknowns on certain element edges or faces. This enhanced cell-centered procedure recovers full accuracy, with little additional cost if the coefficients or mesh geometry are piecewise smooth. Theoretical error estimates and numerical examples are given, illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the methods."},

From the review: "Reliable finite difference methods that approximate solutions to a wide class of partial differential equations can be constructed using the support-operators method, in which differential operators such as the divergence, gradient, curl, and their adjoints are approximated from coordinate-invariant definitions and various integral identities. In previous papers the authors have derived natural discrete approximations to these operators, compatible adjoints, and demonstrated that theorems from vector analysis, such as Gauss's theorem, have discrete analogues for these operators. In the present paper the authors consider a discrete analogue of the orthogonal decomposition theorem for vector fields. The theorem, which plays an important role both in the theory and in the discretization of the Navier-Stokes and electrodynamics equations, states that a vector function in a bounded domain is uniquely determined by its divergence, curl, and normal components on the boundary. After a detailed review of the previous results needed to understand the extension of their work, the authors introduce the continuum version of the orthogonal decomposition theorem, state a discrete analogue, and prove that the solution to the discrete analogue exists and is unique provided the natural discretizations of the operators and their adjoints are used. Finally, it is shown how to decompose a discrete vector field into its orthogonal components involving curl and gradient. The procedure is illustrated with an example."},

Among the possible applications of the proposed theory, it is proved for the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that the lowest-order edge elements satisfy discrete compactness and provide convergent approximations even in the analysis of eigenproblems involving anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and discontinuous material properties.

In particular, every differential $k$-form may be represented by a formal $k$-cochain over a cellular structure that we call a starplex, and exterior differentiation is equivalent to the coboundary operation on the corresponding $k$-cochain. Furthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between this model and the classical finite cellular model supported by the generalized Stokes' theorem, and translation between the two models can be completely automated. "Our results point the way to a common combinatorial and data structure well-suited for a physical modeling computer algebra that unifies finite and infinitesimal, symbolic and numeric, geometric and physical descriptions of distributed phenomena. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by a prototype interactive physics editor that uses the computer algebra to automatically translate intuitive geometrical/physical descriptions of balance conditions created by the user into the corresponding symbolic differential and integral equations."},

Mimetic methods are those that preserve discrete analogues of fundamental integral identities, such as the divergence theorem. In this article the support operators method is utilized, where an initial discrete approximation for a first-order operator is employed to construct a discretization for another operator. This is done by a discrete formulation of an integral identity with the aid of a discrete scalar product. For example, an approximation of the divergence supports an approximation of the gradient, by Gauss's Theorem. In this paper, convergence of the support operator discretization for linear diffusion is shown by developing a connection of this mimetic discretization with mixed finite element methods on triangular and quadrilateral grids. The convergence properties are verified by numerical examples."},
