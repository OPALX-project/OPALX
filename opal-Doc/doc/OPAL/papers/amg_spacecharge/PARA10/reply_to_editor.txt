Dear Kristjan,

we have completed the revision of our paper 

"Improvements of a Fast Parallel Poisson Solver on Irregular Domains".

Notice the correct title of the paper!

We addressed all issues that the referees raised.  Most were minor
rewordings and we do not mention them here.  Two however are worth
noting:

(1) We (hopefully) better explain the differences of our iterative
solver and the traditional FFT-based solver.  This concerns the first
paragraph of section 4.  We hope that it is now intelligible why there
can be significant differences in the results.

(2) We added a sentence on p.5, emphasizing the meaning of column 'total ML'.

(3) We added a small paragraph on p. 8, addressing the question how much
scalability depends on the problem size.

We hope that you are satisfied with the changes.


Congratulations for adhering to the tight schedule.  I am amazed at the
number of papers you could handle in this period of time.


Best wishes,
Peter
