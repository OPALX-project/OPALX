                  in cavities. The Maxwell equations for the strength of the electric field are solved by
                  a mixed method with quadratic finite edge (N{\'e}d{\'e}lec) elements for the field
                  values and corresponding node-based finite elements for the Lagrange multiplier, This
                  approach avoids so-called spurious modes which are introduced if the divergence-free
                  condition for the electric field is not treated properly. To compute a few of the smalles
                  positive eigenvalues and corresponding eigenmodes of the resulting large sparse-matrix
                  eigenvalue problems, two algorithms have been used: the implicitly restarted Lanczos
                  algorithm and the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm, both with shit-and-invert spectral transformation.
                  Two-level hierarchical basis preconditioners have been employed for the iterative solution
                  of the resulting systems of equations.}
