Block structured adaptive mesh refinement was originally developed by
Berger and Oliger [BO84] for hyperbolic equations. In this approach a
hierarchy of refinement grids is constructed dynamically based on a
suitable error estimate of the solution.  Every few time steps a new
error estimate is computed and a completely new hierarchy of grids is
determined.

}

These algorithms have been implemented with AMR in the style of Berger-
Oligier and Berger-Collela [5, 2, 3] in the AMRCLAW software package as
part of CLAWPACK [7, 4]. When this algorithm is applied to mapped grids,
we refine grid cells by relying on an underlying smooth mapping function
that tells us how to subdivide a coarse mesh cell. That is, the
â€œmidpointâ€ of two neighboring corners of a coarse cell is defined as the
point along the curve, defined by our smooth mapping, passing through
those two points. This eliminates the need to construct a smooth mapping
through coarse grid points, as is done, for example, in the method
developed in [1, 10]. Our strategy has the advantage of simplicity,
particularly when extending the method to three dimensions. The
disadvantage of this strategy, however, is that underlying refined cells
are not necessarily contained in their corresponding coarse cell.

Much of the previous work in AMR methods has concentrated on solving
hyperbolic equations with explicit timestepping. However, for many
problems, either due to their physical nature (e.g., incompressible
flows) or for performance reasons (semiimplicit and implicit numerical
methods), it becomes necessary to solve global equations.

This paper focuses on the application and performance of
well-established preconditioned Krylov-Schwarz solvers in an AMR
context, using a Krylov-Schwarz method to accelerate convergence while
exploiting the hierarchical structure of AMR grids for multi-level
preconditioning using the fast adpative composite (FAC) algorithm.  We
present an implementation that allows us to leverage the powerful supply
of preconditioners and linear solvers from the PETSc library.

We apply this method to solve the three-dimensional Euler equations in
the search for a finite-time singularity.

2.2 Adaptive mesh refinement 

Looking for singularities, the method of adaptive mesh refinement is an
ideal tool.  Starting out from a uniform grid, the local truncations
errors are monitored and new, refined grids are introduced to cover
those regions where the error exceeds a certain threshold. In addition,
buffer cells are included in the direction of anticipated movement of
the small-scale structures to ensure sufficient resolution until the
next refinement procedure. While not being generally useful for, e.g.,
turbulence studies, where small-scale structures form all over, adaptive
mesh refinement proves very efficient for problems where only localized
small scales occur, such as in the development of a singularity. It
enables us to follow the evolving singular structures with a much higher
precision than what a legacy uniform grid code could achieve.

To exemplify the efficency gain obtainable by using AMR, we show an
analysis from previous work (current sheets developing in 2D MHD) in
Table 1 [6]. Taking into account all the ghost cells needed for the
adaptive treatment, the adaptive simulation still uses only 2 percent of
the resources needed to solve the problem to the same precision on a
uniform grid.

Within our integration with the PETSc [1, 2, 3] library, most of the
operations applied during the numerical integration can be written in
terms of a sparse matrix multiplication. An advantage here is that we
can exploit PETScâ€™s optimized linear algebra operations, which overlap
communication costs for passing of nonlocal boundary data with
computation of the processor-local data. It is of course still desirable
to keep as much of the work local as possible, which is achieved by
using a Hilbert-Peano curve for load-balancing. Our AMR technology uses
a so-called oct-tree approach, i.e., we do not support patches of
arbitrary extensions, but instead always break up one box which needs
refinement into eight (four in 2D) new boxes of the same shape, which
provides a slightly less effective covering but has advantages when it
comes to parallelizing and load-balancing.

For visualization purposes, we show the adaptive covering with different
levels of resolution for a 2D example, current sheets developing in
Hall-MHD simulated within our framework, in Figure 2b. The basic
procedure of subdividing grids can clearly be seen there.

The basics of the load-balancing algorithm are visualized in Figure
2a. It shows a sample adaptive domain coverage with adaptive grids at
different levels of resolution, as well as the Hilbert-Peano curve
mapping those grids and the resulting distribution onto processors.

The Hilbert-Peano curve has the mathematical property that grids that
are close in two or three dimensions, respectively, are on average also
close on the onedimensional curve. The one-dimensional curve is divided
into equal intervals, the grids on each interval are assigned to a
particular processor. In the figure, the colors denote different
processors, and it can easily be seen that grids which are kept on a
particular processor are generally clustered together, which means the
local set of grids typically has a lot of common boundaries not
requiring expensive interprocessor communication, but only few
boundaries to grids on other processors.

2.3 Multiâ€“level elliptic solvers

A major challenge for the numerical integration of the incompressible
Euler equations is the need to solve elliptic equations on the grid
hierarchy generated by the AMR framework. The underlying strategy
employed here is a variant of the fast adaptive composite algorithm
(FAC) developed by McCormick [9].

   Residuals are computed on the local fine grid including its boundary
   and first border; these residuals are then transferred to the coarse
   grid points lying ander the fine grid and at the interface; the
   correction is the computed and interpolated to the local fine grid
   including its boundary and both borders; relaxation is then performed
   at fine grid interior points.

3. Application

The Berger and Oliger AMR algorithm organizes refined regions into
rectangular structured grids of several hundred to several thousand grid
points per grid. Highresolution structured-grid methods (typically
expressed as stencils) are used to advance the solution in
time. Furthermore, the overhead of managing the irregular data is
amortized over a relatively large number of floating point operations on
the rectangular grids. For timedependent problems, refinement is
performed in time as well as space. Each level of spatial refinement has
its own stable time step, with the time steps on a level constrained to
be integer multiples of the time steps on all finer levels.

3.1 Chombo AMR Framework

AMR applications require a long-term sustained investment in software
infrastructure to create scalable solvers that are capable of utilizing
the full capabilities of the largest available HPC platforms. We have
created a framework for implementing scalable parallel AMR calculations
called Chombo [4] that provides an environment for rapidly assembling
portable, high-performance AMR applications for a broad variety of
scientific disciplines.

Chombo is a fully instrumented C++ library. There
are a set of timer macros that can be used to time functions
or sections of code. These timers attempt to use
native instructions on the target architecture in order
to minimize the overhead of collecting detailed performance
data. In the case of the Cray XT, Chombo measures
elapsed time using the rdtsc x86 assembly instruction.
This returns a 64-bit unsigned integer representing
the number of clock cycles since last processor
reset. On the AMD Opteron processor this instruction
takes, on average, 13 cycles to execute, and for a
2.6GHz clock provides a 0.385 nanosecond timing resolution.
The timers collect information which is summarized
and output at the end of a run for each processor.
The output of the Chombo timing infrastructure is similar
in format to the GNU profiler (gprof) output but
only instrumented functions and sections of code are reported.
This information is then post-processed to produce
various statistics, e.g., mean/min/max times, standard
deviations, and correlations.

                  A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is applied in order to minimize the

                  the unperturbed object is completely known, it is possible off-line

                  in the electromagnetic imaging. In the first part of the paper,
                  the possible resolution of image is investigated in the inversion of
                  far-field data using the diffraction tomographic (DT) algorithm, where
                  two cases are considered when the object is in a homogeneous space 
                  and in an air-earth half space. The study shows that the resolution
                  of image for inversion of far-field data has been limited theoreti-
                  cally to 0.3536-0.5 wavelength using the DT algorithm in homo-
                  geneous-space problems, and it is even worse in half-space prob-
                  lems. If the transmitters and receivers are located in the near-field
                  regime, however, the image resolution is less than 0.25 wavelength, 
                  which is the super-resolution phenomenon. In the second part of
                  the paper, the physical reason for the super-resolution phenomenon
                  is investigated using different electromagnetic inverse scattering methods.
                  The study has demonstrated that the information of evanescent waves
                  in the measurement data and its involvement in inversion algorithms
                  is the main reason for the super resolution. 
                  Four inversion algorithms are considered for half-space problems:
                  the DT algorithm, the spatial-domain Born approximation (BA),
                  the Born iterative method (BIM), and the distorted BIM (DBIM).
                  The first two belong to linear inverse scattering, while the last two
                  belong to nonlinear inverse scattering. Further analysis shows that
                  DBIM provides a better super resolution than BIM, and BIM pro- 
                  vides abetter super resolution than BA. Numerical simulations
                  validate the above conclusions.}

                  optical microscopy during the last years. The finite difference time domain method, using an orthogonal
                  discretization scheme, has often been used for full-wave three-dimensional studies. Because optical near-field
                  configurations are often characterized by curvilinear shapes, locally refined, tetrahedral grids are better
                  suited to describe the geometry. Where fine geometrical details must be resolved or the field solution is
                  expected to vary rapidly, the elements are made smaller while in the other regions a coarser mesh can be used,
                  thereby reducing the size of the problem and promoting computational efficiency. In this study, we use a finite
                  element approach that solves the electric field vector wave (curl-curl) equation in the time domain (FETD)
                  to investigate a novel, scanning near-field optical probe concept with asymmetric cladding. A specific advantage
                  of the finite element method is its inherent capability to discretize the curl-curl equation in a non-uniform way.
                  The finite element method is therefore particularly suited to approximate the geometry of an optical near-field
                  configuration. We model a simplified setup, introduce specific approximations and discuss the method's capabilities
                  and its potential for modeling more complex configurations.}

   note      = {Third-order explicit autonomous differential equations in one scalar variable or, mechanically interpreted, jerky dynamics constitute an interesting subclass of
       dynamical systems that can exhibit many major features of regular and irregular or chaotic dynamical behavior. In this paper, we investigate the circumstances
       under which three dimensional autonomous dynamical systems possess at least one equivalent jerky dynamics. In particular, we determine a wide class of
       three-dimensional vector fields with polynomial and non-polynomial nonlinearities that possess this property. Taking advantage of this general result, we focus
       on the jerky dynamics of Sprott's minimal chaotic dynamical systems and R?ssler's toroidal chaos model. Based on the interrelation between the jerky dynamics of
       these models, we classify them according to their increasing polynomial complexity. Finally, we also provide a simple criterion that excludes chaotic dynamics
       for some classes of jerky dynamics and, therefore, also for some classes of three-dimensional dynamical systems. (C) 1998 The American Physical Society

       We developed a new, three-dimensional simulation code ETRA3D to calculate beam dynamics in the injector of PNC's high-power,
       high-duty electron linac. In ETRA3D, beam dynamics is calculated by the Hamilton equations, and a space-charge force is determined
       by the potentials produced by the other electrons. The Hamiltonian is assessed at each time-step, and the length of the time-step
       is varied by changing in the Hamiltonian to reduce calculation time and errors. 
       
       The precision of ETRA3D was checked by comparing it with the envelope equation; the agreement between them was good. We
       demonstrated the capabilities of ETRA3D by an example in which the electron beam is not launched along the axis of a series of the
       solenoid coils; under this condition, two-dimensional codes cannot calculate its dynamics. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   note      = {e explore some of the effects that discreteness and two-body scattering may have on N-body simulations with ``realistic'' cosmological initial conditions. We use an
       identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a $128^3$ Particle-Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We
       investigate the effect of mass resolution (the mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have high resolution in gravitational force. The
       phase-insensitive two--point statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater
       differences. Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is held
       constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This shows high particle
       density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a PM run which continued the
       fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting
       in a high particle density. Since the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle separation, we find little justification for quantitative
       predictions on this scale. Some measures vary by 50              halos, formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc. Randall J. Splinter}

   note      = {We explore some of the effects that discreteness and two-body scattering may have on N-body simulations with ``realistic'' cosmological initial conditions. We use an
       identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a $128^3$ Particle-Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We
       investigate the effect of mass resolution (the mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have high resolution in gravitational force. The
       phase-insensitive two--point statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater
       differences. Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is held
       constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This shows high particle
       density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a PM run which continued the
       fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting
       in a high particle density. Since the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle separation, we find little justification for quantitative
       predictions on this scale. Some measures vary by 50              halos, formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc.}

  number={12},
  pages={1554-1557},
  year={2001},
  abstract={Beam halo-chaos is essentially a complex spatiotemporal chaotic motion in a periodic-focusing channel of a high-power linear proton accelerator. The controllability condition for beam halo-chaos is analysed qualitatively. A special nonlinear control method, i.e.~the wavelet-based function feedback, is proposed for controlling beam halo-chaos. Particle-in-cell simulations are used to explore the nature of halo-chaos formation, which has shown that the beam halo-chaos is suppressed effectively after using nonlinear control for the proton beam with an initial full Gaussian distribution. The halo intensity factor  H $_{ av }$ is reduced from 14\% to zero, and the other statistical physical quantities of beam halo-chaos are more than doubly reduced. The potential applications of such nonlinear control in experiments are briefly pointed out. }

The analysis is carried out for a thin beam with characteristic beam radius rb<<S, and the transverse momentum components and axial momentum spread of the beam particles are assumed to be small in comparison with the directed axial momentum &gamma;bm&beta;bc. The general formalism is applied to a periodically focused Vlasov equilibrium with step-function radial density profile and average azimuthal motion of the beam corresponding to a rigid rotation (in the Larmor frame) about the axis of symmetry. A variety of beam equilibrium properties are presented, such as the average flow velocity, and the transverse temperature profile.},

	Note = {Third-order explicit autonomous differential equations in one scalar variable or, mechanically interpreted, jerky dynamics constitute an interesting subclass of dynamical systems that can exhibit many major features of regular and irregular or chaotic dynamical behavior. In this paper, we investigate the circumstances under which three dimensional autonomous dynamical systems possess at least one equivalent jerky dynamics. In particular, we determine a wide class of three-dimensional vector fields with polynomial and non-polynomial nonlinearities that possess this property. Taking advantage of this general result, we focus on the jerky dynamics of Sprott's minimal chaotic dynamical systems and R?ssler's toroidal chaos model. Based on the interrelation between the jerky dynamics of these models, we classify them according to their increasing polynomial complexity. Finally, we also provide a simple criterion that excludes chaotic dynamics for some classes of jerky dynamics and, therefore, also for some classes of three-dimensional dynamical systems.

In ETRA3D, beam dynamics is calculated by the Hamilton equations, and a space-charge force is determined by the potentials produced by the other electrons. The Hamiltonian is assessed at each time-step, and the length of the time-step is varied by changing in the Hamiltonian to reduce calculation time and errors. The precision of ETRA3D was checked by comparing it with the envelope equation; the agreement between them was good. We demonstrated the capabilities of ETRA3D by an example in which the electron beam is not launched along the axis of a series of the solenoid coils; under this condition, two-dimensional codes cannot calculate its dynamics.

	Note = {e explore some of the effects that discreteness and two-body scattering may have on N-body simulations with ``realistic'' cosmological initial conditions. We use an identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a $128^3$ Particle-Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We investigate the effect of mass resolution (the mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have high resolution in gravitational force. The phase-insensitive two--point statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater differences. Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is held constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This shows high particle density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a PM run which continued the fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting in a high particle density. Since the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle separation, we find little justification for quantitative predictions on this scale. Some measures vary by 50 halos, formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc. Randall J. Splinter},

We use an identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a $128^3$ Particle-Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We investigate the effect of mass resolution (the mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have high resolution in gravitational force. The phase-insensitive two--point statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater differences. Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is held constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This shows high particle density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a PM run which continued the fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting in a high particle density. Since the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle separation, we find little justification for quantitative predictions on this scale. Some measures vary by 50 halos, formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc.},

@article{Fang2001,
	Abstract = {Beam halo-chaos is essentially a complex spatiotemporal chaotic motion in a periodic-focusing channel of a high-power linear proton accelerator. The controllability condition for beam halo-chaos is analysed qualitatively. A special nonlinear control method, i.e.~the wavelet-based function feedback, is proposed for controlling beam halo-chaos. Particle-in-cell simulations are used to explore the nature of halo-chaos formation, which has shown that the beam halo-chaos is suppressed effectively after using nonlinear control for the proton beam with an initial full Gaussian distribution. The halo intensity factor  H $_{ av }$ is reduced from 14\% to zero, and the other statistical physical quantities of beam halo-chaos are more than doubly reduced. The potential applications of such nonlinear control in experiments are briefly pointed out. },

	Note = {{\em NOTES:} Not a mimetic publication per se, this early pure math book contains descriptions of generic tetrahedral edge- and face- elements etc. The "geometric integration" in the title has "nothing" to do with the numerical ODEs research area of the same name. From the review: "Integration, in the sense of an extended theory of differential forms, is developed here with an approach dual to that of the theory of currents (de Rham, L. Schwartz). An $r$-cochain is a linear function of polyhedral $r$-chains in Euclidean $E^n$. Integration enters by assuming continuity conditions on the cochain (so that then one can, by approximation, use the cochain to integrate over more general domains, such as curved surfaces); one requires the cochain to be bounded with respect to one of two norms in the linear space of polyhedral $r$-chains. The flat norm is defined by $|A|^{\flat}=\inf$\{$|A-\partial D|+|D|\colon D$ an $(r+1)$-chain\}, where $| |$ is the "mass" of a chain derived in the natural way from the $r$-volume. The sharp norm $|A|^{\sharp}$ takes into account the possibility of translating pieces of $A$ in various directions; $|A|^{\sharp}\leq|A|^{\flat}$ holds. By completion one gets the spaces of flat, resp. sharp, chains; their duals are the flat, resp. sharp, cochains. As an example, a flat 0-cochain is identical with a "real sharp" function, i.e., a real-valued bounded function with a uniform Lipschitz condition. These cochains are now identified with certain types of differential forms. The minor result (Thm. 10A) makes sharp cochains correspond to sharp forms; these are bounded and satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to a certain norm in the space of forms, called the comass. The major result (Thm. 7C due to J. H. Wolfe) identifies flat cochains with flat forms; these are forms that are measurable, and bounded in a certain sense. For $r=n$ this is classical theorem on differentiation of set functions, and identifies flat $n$-forms with bounded measurable functions. For $r=1$ it leads to Rademacher's theorem on differentiability of Lipschitz functions. The importance of flat cochains derives from the fact that the exterior derivative can be defined (as dual of the ordinary boundary in the space of chains); by the identification this defines the exterior derivative of a flat form. Similarly the exterior product exists for flat cochains; and for a complex $K\subset E^n$ there is an isomorphism between the flat cohomology ring and the usual algebraic cohomology ring. The "reasonable" maps of this theory are the Lipschitz maps; they preserve flat cochains, and have the usual properties. The theory is developed in many directions, e.g., the connection between sharp $r$-chains and measurable functions whose values are $r$-vectors. In addition there is given a development of Grassmann algebra, a treatment of differential forms in the classical sense including things like the implicit function theorem and differential forms in a smooth manifold, integration of continuous forms over simplexes by a straightforward Riemann-type process, a proof of Stokes' theorem for reasonable $(n-1)$-forms over domains with reasonable boundary in $E^n$ that seems very well adapted to the usual applications. Finally, there is a chapter with the theorem that smooth (separable) manifolds can be imbedded in Euclidean space, and utilizing this fact, a quite simple and straightforward proof for triangulability of smooth manifolds. An elementary proof of de Rham's theorem and some remarks on the Hopf invariant conclude this chapter. The introductory chapter provides the motivation for the general theory and treats the 3-dimensional case in detail."},

This permits us to assign a definite behaviour of physical quantities under time reversal and space inversion. The association of physical quantities with chrono-geometric objects gives a motivation for the introduction in physical theories of the notions of multivectors, fiber bundles, exterior differential forms and connection theory. Typical equations of physics are shown to be described by a single mathematical process, the coboundary process (exterior differential). The basic equations of physics are then divided into two classes: metric independent equations, i.e., purely topological equations, and metric dependent equations, the phenomenological equations. Classification schemes for the main physical theories conclude the paper."},

These difference operators have the main properties of the corresponding differential operators such as $$ \oint_S\varphi(\vec A,\vec n)\,dS=\int_V\varphi\mbox{div}\vec A\,dV+\int_V(\vec A,\mbox{grad}\,\varphi)\,dV. \mbox{\bf (1)}$$ In the present paper they extend their investigations to the operators of tensor analysis. The construction of the operators is made in the following way. Directly on the mesh, they approximate one of the operators div, grad or rot and consider it as a determining difference operator. Under conditions of compatibility, similar to (1) but for tensor objects, the finite difference approximations of the other operators are derived. The technique developed is illustrated on the dynamic equations of continuous media for elastic-plastic flows. This novel method is perfectly suitable for numerical solution of the multidimensional, nonlinear problems of mathematical physics and may have a wide range of applications."},

	Note = {A generalized approach to second order elliptic problems. {\em NOTES:} From the review: "This monograph is devoted to the analysis and justification of the balance method, often called the box or finite control volume method. With the exception of the last chapter the author considers the equation (1) $Lu=f(x)$, $x=(x_1, x_2)\in \Omega\subset \mathbf R^2$, with mixed boundary conditions where $Lu$ is a formally selfadjoint elliptic operator. The boundary value problem is briefly written in the form (2) $Au=F$. Irregular grids formed by triangles, rectangles and the combination of these elements are described in great detail. In addition, secondary grids are introduced by defining boxes via the perpendicular bisectors or via the medians. The balance method starts with identities called balance equations. For instance, in the case of the Poisson equation $-\Delta u=f(x)$, by using the Gauss formula we obtain (3) $-\int_{\partial \kappa} (\partial u/\partial n)\,ds=\int_\kappa f\,dx$ for all $\kappa \subset \overline{\Omega}$. Discretizing (3), where $\kappa$ is a box, by means of suitable quadrature and finite difference formulas we obtain the discrete operator $A_h$ and the discrete right-hand side $F_h$, and the discrete solution $y$ is defined by $A_h y=F_h$. Here $A_h$ and $F_h$ are constructed for the case that the operator $Lu$ is of the form $(4) Lu=-\sum^2_{i=1} (\partial/\partial x_i)(k\partial u/\partial x_i) +cu.$ The author studies the properties of $A_h$ and the corresponding matrices, especially with respect to monotonicity ($M$-matrices), symmetry and positive definiteness. Discrete analogues of Sobolev norms as well as the $C$-norm are introduced. A trace theorem, discrete analogues of the Green formula and of the Friedrichs-Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities are derived. Further, estimates of $A_h$ in different norms are given. An approach is developed to get error estimates and convergence proofs with discrete analogues of the $W^2_1$- and $C$-norms under the assumption that $u\in W^k_2(\Omega)$, $k\ge 2$. In the last short chapter the author applies the balance method to the solution of the diffusion-convection equation using upwind approximation with respect to the coordinate axes."},

Using the finite volume method, we derive local, accurate, reliable and efficient difference methods that mimic these properties on nonuniform rectangular and cuboid grids.

The approximations are required to satisfy symmetry relationships that come from the analogous higher-dimensional fundamental operators: the divergence, the gradient, and the Laplacian. For example, we require that the discrete divergence and gradient be negative adjoint of each other, ${\rm DIV}^*=-{\rm GRAD}$, and the discrete Laplacian is defined as ${\rm LAP}={\rm DIVGRAD}$. The adjointness requirement on the divergence and gradient guarantees that the Laplacian is a symmetric negative operator. The discrete approximations we derive are fourth-order on smooth grids, but the approach can be extended to create approximations of arbitrarily high order. We analyze the loss of accuracy in the approximations when the grid is not smooth and include a numerical example demonstrating the effectiveness of the higher order methods on nonuniform grids."},

The main subject matter is the "description of some regular methods for constructing intrinsically defined discrete models for special classes of continual objects". There is an introductory chapter giving an idea of what is meant, in the following, by finite models and their characteristics (Chapter 0: One-dimensional models). Five other chapters cover around 200 pages: 1. Formal structures, 2. Analysis of Riemannian manifolds, 3. The model of Euclidean space and difference operators, 4. Models in quantum physics, and 5. Structural analysis of discrete equations. Sixty-nine references are also specified (a majority of them being of difficult access) leading to very different concepts not sufficiently defined in the book. Addressed essentially to mathematical physicists, such a book asks for too many complementary readings in order to become interesting. I have personally visited the fourth chapter as a quantum physicist and I am still waiting for new results. Let me mention a typical way of thinking included in many parts of the book: the author writes "It should be pointed out in conclusion that it would be interesting to compare the content of Sections 1.2, 1.3 with the draft of quantum mechanics suggested by A. I. Kostrikin and Y. I. Manin [Linear algebra and geometry (Russian), Second edition, "Nauka", Moscow, 1986; MR 87f:00006]."

Consequently, the matrices for the discrete problem are symmetric and positive definite. Also, the scheme has a nearest neighbor stencil.

It is the generality of the problem (general matrix coefficients, general boundary conditions, general logically rectangular grids) that makes finding such an algorithm difficult.

	Note = {{\em NOTES:} Support Operator Method. Extensive bibliography. Preface: "The desire to solve challenging new problems imposes additional requirements for the quality and robustness of numerical algorithms used to simulate such problems. A number of factors in real problems make designing algorithms difficult, including nonlinearity, discontinuity of coefficients or solutions, complexity of the physical processes, and irregular geometry. Experience has shown that the best results usually are obtained by using discrete models that reproduce fundamental properties of the original continuum model of the underlying physical problem. Some of these important properties are conservation, symmetries of the solution, etc. Modeling becomes increasingly difficult as the number of physical processes increases, the shape of the physical domain becomes more complex, and boundary conditions are made more realistic. The development of discrete algorithms that capture all the important characteristics of such physical problems becomes more difficult with this increasing complexity. Thus, it is important to have a discretization method that is sufficiently general that it applies to a wide range of physical systems. Many important simulation algorithms necessarily involve the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Most of these PDEs can be formulated using invariant first-order differential operators, such as the divergence of vectors and tensors, the gradient of scalars and vectors, and the curl of vectors. Therefore, it is possible to construct `good' finite-difference schemes (FDSs) for approximating a wide class of problems, if it is possible to construct discrete analogues of these invariant operators so that the discrete operators also have `good' properties that are analogous to those of the continuum operators. "First-order differential operators are the main objects in vector and tensor analysis. These operators satisfy certain integral identities, usually associated with the names of Green, Gauss, and Stokes, that are closely related to the conservation laws of the continuum models. Therefore, to obtain high-quality FDSs, it is important to construct discrete analogues of the continuum divergence, gradient, and curl, which satisfy discrete analogues of these integral identities. In this book, FDSs are considered to be a discrete model of the continuum physical system. It is emphasized that, when computing numerical solutions to PDEs, the discrete difference operators should mimic the crucial properties of the continuum differential operators, and that such discretizations are usually more accurate than those that do not mimic these properties. Properties such as symmetry, conservation, stability, and the integral identities between the gradient, curl, and divergence are all important. The support-operators method for constructing FDSs that mimic these properties is emphasized in this book. The terminology `support operators' comes from the translation of papers in Russian. Unfortunately, this is not a good translation. More appropriate would be fundamental, basic, or reference operators. As many papers have been translated from Russian using this terminology, we have elected not to change it. Many of the standard finite-difference methods are special cases of the support-operators method. Also, it is important to realize that the popular finite-volume methods are special cases of the support-operators method. In this case the finite-volume approach gives an approximation of the divergence. Unlike elementary finite-difference methods, the support-operators method can be used to construct FDSs on grids of arbitrary structure. In addition, because invariant operators are used, the method can be easily used in any coordinate system. This gives some idea of the universality of the support-operators method. This book deals with the construction of finite-difference algorithms, in Cartesian coordinates, for three main types of equations: elliptic or steady-state equations, parabolic or diffusion equations, and gas dynamics equations in Lagrangian form. The methods apply to domains of arbitrary shape. Therefore this book gives scientists and engineers tools for solving real practical problems. The presentation of the material in this book is constructive; all of the details of algorithms needed for its implementation are given. The theoretical material is covered briefly and only when this contributes to a better understanding of the applications and properties of the algorithms. Many illustrations are used to help the reader understand the material. In addition, the results of solving many test problems are also presented. To increase the utility of the book, computer codes implementing the basic algorithms are provided on the floppy disk that is included with this book. This book is unique because it is the first book not in Russian to present the support-operators ideas. The background needed to understand this book is matrix theory, vector calculus, the elementary theory of PDEs, introductory finite-difference techniques, and elementary numerical programming techniques."},

Summary: "A finite-difference algorithm for the numerical solution of diffusion problems in strongly heterogeneous and nonisotropic media is constructed for logically rectangular grids. The performance of this algorithm is comparable to other algorithms for problems with smooth coefficients and regular grids, and it is superior for problems with rough coefficients and/or skewed grids. The algorithm is derived using the support-operators method, which constructs discrete analogues of the divergence and flux operator that satisfy discrete analogues of the important integral identities relating the continuum operators. This paper gives the first application of this method to the solution of diffusion problems in heterogeneous and nonisotropic media. The support-operators method forces the discrete analogue of the flux operator to be the negative adjoint of the discrete divergence in an inner product weighted by the conductivity, as in the differential case. Once this is accomplished, many other important properties follow; for example, the scheme is conservative and the discrete analogue of the variable material Laplacian is symmetric and negative definite. In addition, on any grid, the discrete divergence is zero on constant vectors and the discrete flux operator is exact for linear functions in the case when $K$ (the conductivity matrix) is piecewise constant. Moreover, the discrete gradient's null space is the constant functions, just as in the continuum. Because the algorithm is flux based, it has twice as many unknowns as more standard algorithms. However, the matrices that need to be inverted are symmetric and positive definite, so the most powerful linear solvers can be applied. Also, the scheme is second-order accurate so, all things considered, it is efficient. For rectangular grids, the discrete operators reduce to well-known discrete operators and the treatment of discontinuous conductivity coefficients in the case of isotropic media is equivalent to the well-known harmonic-averaging procedure. Comparison with standard schemes is presented. Numerical examples validate the advantage of the new method."},

For the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces, we use quadrature rules to reduce the method to cell-centered finite differences, possibly enhanced with some face-centered pressures. This substantially reduces the computational complexity of the problem to a symmetric, positive definite system for essentially only as many unknowns as elements. Our new method handles general shape elements (triangles, quadrilaterals, and hexahedra) and full tensor coefficients, while the standard mixed formulation reduces to finite differences only in special cases with rectangular elements. As in other mixed methods, we maintain the local approximation of the divergence (i.e., local mass conservation). In contrast, Galerkin finite element methods facilitate general element shapes at the cost of achieving only global mass conservation. Our method is shown to be as accurate as the standard mixed method for a large class of smooth meshes. On nonsmooth meshes or with nonsmooth coefficients one can add Lagrange multiplier pressure unknowns on certain element edges or faces. This enhanced cell-centered procedure recovers full accuracy, with little additional cost if the coefficients or mesh geometry are piecewise smooth. Theoretical error estimates and numerical examples are given, illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the methods."},

This flexible approach can accommodate elements of more complicated shapes than merely tetrahedra and bricks. The pyramid serves as an example for the successful application of the construction; new Whitney forms are derived for it and they display all the desirable properties of conforming finite elements."},

From the review: "Reliable finite difference methods that approximate solutions to a wide class of partial differential equations can be constructed using the support-operators method, in which differential operators such as the divergence, gradient, curl, and their adjoints are approximated from coordinate-invariant definitions and various integral identities. In previous papers the authors have derived natural discrete approximations to these operators, compatible adjoints, and demonstrated that theorems from vector analysis, such as Gauss's theorem, have discrete analogues for these operators. In the present paper the authors consider a discrete analogue of the orthogonal decomposition theorem for vector fields. The theorem, which plays an important role both in the theory and in the discretization of the Navier-Stokes and electrodynamics equations, states that a vector function in a bounded domain is uniquely determined by its divergence, curl, and normal components on the boundary. After a detailed review of the previous results needed to understand the extension of their work, the authors introduce the continuum version of the orthogonal decomposition theorem, state a discrete analogue, and prove that the solution to the discrete analogue exists and is unique provided the natural discretizations of the operators and their adjoints are used. Finally, it is shown how to decompose a discrete vector field into its orthogonal components involving curl and gradient. The procedure is illustrated with an example."},

While necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for both definitions, only for the newly proposed one is it proved that whether or not an approximation converges for a given family of finite element triangulations is independent of the properties of the materials filling the cavity modelled by the electromagnetic eigenproblem. Among the possible applications of the proposed theory, it is proved for the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that the lowest-order edge elements satisfy discrete compactness and provide convergent approximations even in the analysis of eigenproblems involving anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and discontinuous material properties.

Summary: "We use tools from algebraic topology to show that a class of structural differential equations may be represented combinatorially, and thus, by a computer data structure. In particular, every differential $k$-form may be represented by a formal $k$-cochain over a cellular structure that we call a starplex, and exterior differentiation is equivalent to the coboundary operation on the corresponding $k$-cochain. Furthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between this model and the classical finite cellular model supported by the generalized Stokes' theorem, and translation between the two models can be completely automated. "Our results point the way to a common combinatorial and data structure well-suited for a physical modeling computer algebra that unifies finite and infinitesimal, symbolic and numeric, geometric and physical descriptions of distributed phenomena. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by a prototype interactive physics editor that uses the computer algebra to automatically translate intuitive geometrical/physical descriptions of balance conditions created by the user into the corresponding symbolic differential and integral equations."},

Although many authors noted this before, Hiptmair not only aims at a unified description of several different physical phenomena but also outlines a general approach which leads to practical hints for the construction of finite element and finite volume approximations for these equations. The author starts from a generic discrete Hodge operator and shows that many FEMs as well as finite volume methods appear to be specializations of this operator. Ideas for a unified convergence analysis in the framework of discrete exterior calculus are outlined."},

Mimetic methods are those that satisfy discrete analogs of differential relationships such as the divergence theorem. For a mimetic method the definition of the discrete gradient depends on the definition of the discrete divergence operator. The authors use the support-operators method to discretize differential equations. It is shown that the proper choice of inner product for scalar functions and vector fields can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the numerical methods. Numerical examples are presented illustrating the improvement due to proper choice of the inner product"},
