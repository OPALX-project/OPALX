Arguments
=========

As for now there are three flags:

--build 

updates and tries to build the sources in ../../opal and ../../classic

--user

should be used when the regression test is run by a user (not cron job). In this
case the script will not send emails and also does not copy the xml results to
the web directory. Additionally the script will be more verbose.  
Note: After submitting a regression test to the batch system the script will
check **every 60 seconds** if the job has finished.

--tests

specifies which regression tests are run, e.g. 

    --tests=BC1-1,RingCyclotron

runs only the BC1-1 and RingCyclotron regression tests (matching on directory 
name).


Required Environment Variables
==============================

The OPAL executable path has to be set with the environment variable 
OPAL_EXE_PATH.
