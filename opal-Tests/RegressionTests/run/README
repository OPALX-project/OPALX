Information
===========

As for now there are two flags:

--build 

that updates and tries builds the sources in ../../opal and ../../classic, and

--user

that should be used when the regression test is run as a user (not cron job). In
this case the script will not send emails and also does not copy the xml results
to the web directory. Additionally the script will be more verbose.

OPAL Executable
===============

The OPAL executable path can be set with the environment variable OPAL_EXE_PATH.
