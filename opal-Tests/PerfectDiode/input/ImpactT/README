This directory contains all that is needed to run an ImpactT simulation of our perfect diode.

The "input-files" directory contains a template file for the simulation.

run-impactt.py	==> Python script for launching ImpactT simulations. This will need to be edited depending on where
		    you want the simulations to take place, what machine you are on etc.

subroutines.py	==> Python functions used by run-impactt.py
